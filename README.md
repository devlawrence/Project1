# Project1

This is my first project.

My name is ESE. I am currently learning CyberSecurity. I'd always wanted to be an IT expert, unfortunately time was not really on my side. I really happy now that the journey have started. We had a hard time configuring the system, am so we are now done with configuration.


Special thanks to my instructor for patience and understanding. 

Thank!
