# Project1

This is my first project.

My name is ESE. I am currently learning CyberSecurity. I'd always wanted to be an IT expert, unfortunately time was not really on my side. I really happy now that the journey have started. We had a hard time configuring the system, almost a week. 


I am glad to be here, hoping complete the programme as soon as possible.
